### 📖 Advanced Guides

#### <a name="cookie-import"></a>🍪 How to Import Cookies

Some restricted videos or high-quality streams require cookies. QvaSave Pro supports importing cookies in **Netscape format**.

1. **Install Extension**: Install [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/ccmclabimipkeocclodkapndfdbobpph) on your desktop browser (Chrome/Edge).
2. **Login**: Log in to the target website (e.g., YouTube) in your browser.
3. **Export**: Click the extension icon, ensure **Netscape** format is selected, and click **Export** to download `cookies.txt`.
4. **Import**: Send the file to your phone and select it in QvaSave Pro -> **Settings** -> **Cookie Management**.

> [!CAUTION]
> Cookies contain sensitive login information. **Never share your cookies.txt file** with others.

#### ⚠️ Custom User-Agent Tip

For sites like YouTube, the default UA might cause parsing failures. We recommend setting a real User-Agent from your current device (Search "My User Agent" in your browser) in the settings.
